Simple YouTube video downloader.

you can download individual video, playlists, videos in channel and videos as mp3 format.

If you are using Linux, you can download raptor.sh file and execute it.

If you are using Windows, you can download raptor.exe and click it. It automatically executes and open up program.

If any error occured send me a message.

Remember, you have to upgrade python3.10 or latest to use this tool, because I used 'match statement'.
